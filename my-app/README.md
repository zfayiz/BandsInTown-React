<h1>About the app</h1>
This is a test app built using React JS, that allows users to search for their favorite artists, get some of their information as well as see their upcoming event data.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
The architecture was designed keeping ease of use in mind. The interactions have been kept simple where a user after inputting the artist's name in the search (and pressing enter) will see result box(es). The result box shows the user the artist's photo, name and facebook link. It also gives the user the option to check out upcoming events that the artist may have with the click of a button.

In short:  Search for Artist --> API retrieves data --> Artist Data shown --> Show Events button clicked --> API retrieves event data --> Event data shown alongside total number of upcoming events.

<h2>Design</h2>
The design was kept simple and minimal following suggested guidelines. The app follows a responsive layout for easy viewing on all screen sizes.
